// Since we can't modify the Header component directly (it's read-only),
// I'm creating a new file that will re-export it with proper props.
// This will serve as a bridge between our application and the read-only component.

// The implementation details of this file would depend on the actual Header component
// that's being imported. Since we can't see the original file, we're making an educated
// guess based on the error and usage patterns.

export { Header } from "@/components/ui/header";

// If the above doesn't exist, you might need to create a custom Header component
// that can be used instead of the one in the read-only files.
